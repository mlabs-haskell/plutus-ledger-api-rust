# Plutus Ledger API

Plutus Ledger types and utilities implemented in Rust.

This library is the common denominator of many Rust based Cardano libraries, such
as the [Transaction Bakery](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/tx-village/blob/main/tx-bakery).

All types has PlutusData serialisation and deserialisation compatible with PlutusTx.
